Using the Editor
--------------------------
LevelImposter utilizes `LevelImposter Editor <https://editor.levelimposter.net/>`_ to create and edit maps.
The editor is a web application that allows you to create maps and save them as .LIM files or publish them to the LevelImposter API.

Making your First Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Launching the editor will create a new map for you.
You may also add objects to the map by clicking on the ``Add Object`` button.
The editor will then open a new window that allows you to select the object you want to add.

LevelImposter includes many types of objects including:

    - ``Tasks``
    - ``Sabotages``
    - ``Vents``
    - ``Dummies``
    - ``Vitals``
    - ``Buttons``
    - ``Decorations``
    - ``Room Templates``
    - and many others

You can either search for these objects, or type the name of your own object you would like to add.

.. note::

    Right click will move your camera, left click will move/select an object.

Selecting an object in the map will allow you to edit any of the properties of the object on the right side panel.
For more information about object properties, you can view :doc:`edit-properties`.
