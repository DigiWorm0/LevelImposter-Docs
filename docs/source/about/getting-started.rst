Play on a Map
---------------

Once you have installed LevelImposter, you can open the Maps menu on the main menu screen.
The Maps menu will display 3 tabs: ``Downloaded``, ``Featured``, and ``Top``.

    - ``Downloaded`` - A list of maps that you have downloaded.
    - ``Featured`` - A list of maps that are featured by the LevelImposter team.
    - ``Top`` - A list of maps that are the most popular.

Once you have a map downloaded, you can either launch the map in freeplay or start a new lobby to play your map with friends.
You may select any downloaded map within the lobby menu. Selected maps will automatically download and syncronize to all connected lobby members.

.. note::

    Using LevelImposter in public lobbies requires all members of the lobby to have the LevelImposter mod installed.
