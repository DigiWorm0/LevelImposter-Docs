Select a Map
---------------

Once you have installed LevelImposter, you can open the map shop on the main menu screen.

.. note::

   Installing maps requires an active internet connection.

In the map shop, you can download any map file. The last map you selected will be utilized instead of the other maps.

Once you have a map downloaded & selected, you can either hop into freeplay or host a new lobby for your friends to join.
Using LevelImposter in public lobbies requires all members of the lobby to have LevelImposter installed.
The specific map selected will be installed and applied onto their game's automatically.
