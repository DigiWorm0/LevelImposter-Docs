API Docs
===================

In order to share maps from client to client, LevelImposter utilizes a simple REST api hosted at ``https://levelimposter.net/api/``.
API keys are not required when searching and downloading maps. However, OAuth Authentication is required in order to upload your own maps.

Further API documentation is provided by `SwaggerHub <https://levelimposter.net/swagger/>`_.
